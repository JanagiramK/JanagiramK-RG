# Legal Writing Guidelines
LEGAL_WRITING_GUIDELINES = """
**Legal Writing Guidelines**

Apply the following principles to improve or evaluate legal writing:

1. **Be Concise**: Express arguments succinctly without losing meaning.
   - *Not concise*: "The argument made by opposing counsel is one that fails to succeed for reasons including, inter alia, the fact that the legislature clearly did not evince an intent to restrict the business activities of the defendant."
   - *More concise*: "Opposing counsel‚Äôs argument fails because the legislature did not intend to limit the defendant‚Äôs business activities."

2. **Use Active Voice**: Clearly identify the action and the actor.
   - *Passive*: "The penalty was called by the referee."
   - *Active*: "The referee called the penalty."

3. **Simplify Legalese**: Replace complex legal terms with simpler language unless necessary.
   - *Examples*: "inter alia" ‚Üí "among other things"; "utilize" ‚Üí "use"

4. **Limit Nominalizations**: Avoid converting verbs into nouns.
   - *Nominalization*: "There was committee agreement."
   - *Fix*: "The committee agreed."

5. **Omit Unnecessary Words and Phrases**: Use simpler words instead of compound constructions.
   - *Examples*: "at the point in time" ‚Üí "then"; "by means of" ‚Üí "by"

6. **Avoid Run-On Sentences**: Focus on one main point per sentence; aim for about 20 words per sentence.

7. **Break Apart Overly Long Paragraphs**: Stick to one idea per paragraph.

8. **Avoid Redundancy**: Use a single word instead of listing synonyms.
   - *Redundant*: "Cease and desist."
   - *Concise*: "Stop."

9. **Avoid Meaningless Adverbs and Weasel Words**: Do not use adverbs or words that weaken your position.
   - *Meaningless*: "Chester v. Morris clearly held..."
   - *Concise*: "Chester v. Morris held..."

10. **Avoid Double Negatives**: Use single positives instead.
    - *Double Negative*: "Not uncommon."
    - *Positive*: "Common."

11. **Omit Phrases with No Meaning**: Remove meaningless phrases to enhance clarity.
    - *Meaningless*: "I would like to point out that..."
    - *Concise*: "Chester v. Morris was overruled."

**Additional Tips**

- **Generate Alternatives**: Present different perspectives fairly or favorably, depending on the context.
- **Marshal Relevant Information**: Gather facts, legal authority, and social authority to support your argument.
- **Examine Information Critically**: Assess the strengths and weaknesses of supporting information.
- **Reach a Conclusion**: Choose the better alternative based on analysis, even if it's not perfect.
