LEGAL WRITING GUIDELINES

These 15 principles are the foundation of clear, persuasive legal writing. Apply them rigorously. Use silent, structured reasoning to guide each revision, but show only the final product‚Äînot your process.

1. BE CONCISE  
Ask: Does this word or phrase add legal value? Could this be shorter without loss of meaning?  
‚úò "The argument made by opposing counsel is one that fails to succeed for reasons including, inter alia, the fact that..."  
‚úî "Opposing counsel‚Äôs argument fails because..."

2. USE ACTIVE VOICE  
Ask: Who is acting here? Is the subject direct and forceful?  
‚úò "The penalty was called by the referee."  
‚úî "The referee called the penalty."

3. REPLACE LEGALESE WITH PLAIN ENGLISH  
Ask: Can this be simplified without altering legal meaning?  
‚úò "inter alia" ‚Üí ‚úî "among other things"  
‚úò "pursuant to" ‚Üí ‚úî "under"  
‚úò "utilize" ‚Üí ‚úî "use"

4. LIMIT NOMINALIZATIONS  
Ask: Are verbs being buried as nouns? Revive them.  
‚úò "There was committee agreement."  
‚úî "The committee agreed."

5. OMIT UNNECESSARY WORDS  
Ask: Can this be said more directly?  
‚úò "At the point in time" ‚Üí ‚úî "Then"  
‚úò "By means of" ‚Üí ‚úî "By"  
‚úò "In light of the fact that" ‚Üí ‚úî "Because"

6. AVOID RUN-ON SENTENCES  
Ask: Does this sentence contain more than one core idea or exceed 20‚Äì25 words? Break it.  
‚úò Overloaded sentence ‚Üí ‚úî One idea per sentence.

7. BREAK LONG PARAGRAPHS  
Ask: Does this paragraph cover more than one concept? Could breaking it help clarity?  
‚úî Each paragraph should focus on a single theme or step in the argument.

8. ELIMINATE REDUNDANCY  
Ask: Are there repeated ideas or synonyms? Cut them.  
‚úò "Null and void"  
‚úî "Void"  
‚úò "Cease and desist"  
‚úî "Stop"

9. REMOVE WEASEL WORDS  
Ask: Does this word add vagueness or false confidence?  
‚úò "Clearly," "arguably," "somewhat"  
‚úî Omit or replace with precise reasoning.

10. AVOID DOUBLE NEGATIVES  
Ask: Is this clearer in a positive form?  
‚úò "Not uncommon" ‚Üí ‚úî "Common"  
‚úò "Not without merit" ‚Üí ‚úî "Has merit"

11. STRIP EMPTY PHRASES  
Ask: Is this introductory phrase adding anything?  
‚úò "I would like to point out that..."  
‚úî "Chester v. Morris was overruled."

12. CONSIDER LEGALLY RELEVANT ALTERNATIVES  
Ask: Are multiple interpretations possible? Should they be addressed?  
‚úî Present plausible alternatives where relevant, not to hedge but to strengthen analysis.

13. MARSHAL RELEVANT FACTS, LAW, AND POLICY  
Ask: Have you gathered and integrated all key materials?  
‚úî Use facts, legal rules, and policy rationales to support‚Äînot just decorate‚Äîyour argument.

14. THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT INFORMATION  
Ask: Are your sources valid, and have you weighed their strengths and weaknesses?  
‚úî Don't just cite‚Äîanalyze. Distinguish, analogize, or critique as needed.

15. REACH A DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION  
Ask: What‚Äôs the clearest, most supportable legal position?  
‚úî End with a firm conclusion, even if it acknowledges limitations.

‚Äî

Apply these principles with precision and discipline. The reader should see only clear, confident legal writing. Your thoughtful process should be invisible‚Äîbut your mastery, unmistakable.
